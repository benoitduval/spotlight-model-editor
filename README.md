# Spotlight Model's Editor

Idio's Spotlight Model Editor allows you to create associations between word forms and 
a DBPedia topic or concept, thus improving the coverage of the topic extraction tool we use.

In order to use the Model Editor, you will need:

- (Oracle) Java 1.7
- Scala >= 2.9.x
- Compiling DBPedia Spotlight from source (see below)
- Compiling Spotlight Model Editor (this tool) from source (see below)
- A pre-computed language model (downloaded from [here](http://spotlight.sztaki.hu/downloads/) )

We also recommend using [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), for editing the code. See below, 
for instructions on how to set up a project.

## Compiling

We assume that you have the correct versions of Java and Scala, also make sure you have `mvn` in your system.
The language models consume a lot of computational resources, so in these instructions we use the model for 
Turkish (located in the `tr` folder). Feel free to play with other languages, if you have a big machine.

### Compiling Dbpedia Spotlight

DBpedia Spotlight's jar is one of the dependencies. These steps will guide you on how to compile spotlight

1. clone `https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight`
2. compile dbpedia spotlight: 
  - `mvn package`

after this step there should be a `dbpedia-spotlight-0.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in the `./dist/target` folder.

### Compiling Idio's Dbpedia Model Editor

1. Clone this repo
2. go to the repo's folder and do:

  ```
  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=path_to_spotlight_jar/dbpedia-spotlight-0.6-jar-with-dependencies.jar -DgroupId=org.dbpedia -DartifactId=spotlight -Dversion=0.6 -Dpackaging=jar
  ```
3. do `mvn compile`
4. do `mvn package`
5. call

```
java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar explore path-to-turkish/tr/model/
```


## Importing Project
1. Get IntelliJ
2. Go to `File`>`Import Project` -> `Select POM Project`
3. Give enough RAM to run the project. Go to `Preferences` -> `Compiler` and add '-Xmx5G' to 'Aditional VM options',
3. Navigate to the `SpotlightModelReader` class, right click `Main` and select `run scala console`, enjoy

## Editing a model
start by freeing  as much ram as possible.

Each of the following tools addressing a `command` refers to calling the jar as follows

```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar <command> arg1 arg2 ... argN
```


### Exploring a Model

- **command**: `explore`
- **arg1**: path to dbpedia spotlight model,`/mnt/share/spotlight/en/model`
- **result**: outputs 40 SurfaceForms with their respective candidates, priors and statistics

example:
```
java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar explore path-to-turkish/tr/model/
```


### Searching a Topic

- **command**: `search`
- **arg1**: path to dbpedia spotlight model,`/mnt/share/spotlight/en/model`
- **arg2**: dbpediaURI
- **result**: looks for a given `DbpediaId` in the Model and returns whether that topic exists or not in the model

i.e :
```
java -jar .... search path/to/model Michael_Schumacherâ€Ž
```

### Getting Data about a SurfaceForm

- **command**: `check`
- **arg1**: path to dbpedia spotlight model,`/mnt/share/spotlight/en/model`
- **arg2**: surfaceForm
- **result**:  outputs the topic candidates and statistics of the given surfaceForm

example :
```
java -Xmx4000M target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar check ~/Downloads/tr/model/ evrimleri
```
would check the candidate topics and statistics for the surface form `evrimleri`

### Making a list of Surface Forms not Spottable

- **command**: `make-sf-not-spottable`
- **arg1**: path to dbpedia spotlight model,`/mnt/share/spotlight/en/model`
- **arg2**: list of Surface Forms separated by `|`. i.e: `how\|How\|Hello\ World`
- **result**: Each `SF` in the piped separated list won't be spottable anymore

```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar make-sf-not-spottable path/to/model listOfPipedSeparatedSurfaceForms
```

example: 

```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar make-sf-not-spottable /mnt/share/spotlight/en/model how\|How\|QC\|the\ one\|The\ one\|The\ One
```
### Making a list of Surface Forms Spottable

- **command**: `make-sf-spottable`
- **arg1**: `pathToSpotlightModel/model`
- **arg2**:  list of Surface Forms separated by `|`. i.e: `how\|How\|Hello\ World`
- **result**: Each `SF` in the piped separated list will be spottable


example: 

```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar make-sf-spottable /mnt/share/spotlight/en/model adobe\|Adobe
```

### Set the Context Words of a Topic

- **command**: `clean-set-context`
- **arg1**: `pathToSpotlightModel/model`
- **arg2**: dbpediaURI
- **arg3**: list of Context Words separated by `|`. i.e: `Word1\|Word2`
- **arg4**: list of context Counts separated by `|` i.e: `1|300`
- **result**: The context words and counts for  `dbpediaURI` will be clear. The specified context Words will be stemmed and added with their respect counts to the context of the given `dbpediaURI`.

example:
```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar clean-set-context /mnt/share/spotlight/en/model Barack_Obama President\|United\|States 10\|54\|3 
```

### Deleting Associations between SF and Topics

- **command**: `remove-sf-topic-association`
- **arg1**: `pathToSpotlightModel/model`
- **arg2**: pathToInputFile
- **result**: All associations between SFs and Topics in the given input file will be deleted from the model.

Every line in the input file describes an association which will be deleted, each line should follow the format:

```
dbpediaURI <tab> Surface Form
```

example:
```
java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar remove-sf-topic-association /mnt/share/spotlight/en/model /path/to/file/file_with_associations
```

### Updating Model From File
When updating the model with lots of `SF`, `Topics` and `Context Words` best is to do it from a file.
each line of the file should follow the format:

```
dbpedia_id <tab> surfaceForm1|surfaceForm2... <tab> contextW1|contextW2... <tab> contextW1Counts|ContextW2Counts
```

#### Insight
Before doing actual changes to the model it might be useful to see how many `SF`,`dbpedia topics` and links between those two are missing.
```java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file-check path/to/en/model path_to_file/with/model/changes```.

#### Updating a model From File (All in One Go)
make sure you have enough ram to hold all the models that should be around `-Xmx15000M`.
do:

```
java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file-update-sf-dbpedia path/to/en/model path_to_file/with/model/changes
```

#### Updating a model From File (Two Steps)
If you don't have enough ram you can update the `SF` and `DbpediaTopics` in one step and the `Context Words` in other, this will require less memory.

1. go to the model folder and rename `context.mem` to `context2.mem` this will avoid the jar to avoid loading the `context store`
2. calling the following command will update the `surfaceform store`, `resource store` and `candidate store`: ```java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file-update-sf-dbpedia path/to/en/model path_to_file/with/model/changes```.
3. a new file `path_to_file/with/model/changes_just_context` will be generated after running the previous command.This file contains dbpediaIds(internal model's indexes) to contextWords, and it can be processed in the following step.
4. rename `context2.mem` to `context.mem`, and rename every other file in the model folder to something else.( if this is not done, the stores will be loaded and they will consume all your ram) 
5. calling the following will update the `context store`: 
```
java -Xmx4000M -jar  target/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file-update-context path/to/en/model path_to_file/with/model/changes_just_context
```
6. rename all files to their usual conventions and enjoy a fresh baked model

steps 1-4 could be applied while ignoring 5 and 6 when: 
- wanting to add `SFs`
- wanting to link `SFs` with already existing `Dbpedia Topic`

steps 5-6 could be applied while ignoring 1-4 when:
- wanting to add Context words to a `Dbpedia Topic`

**Important**:  
- `step 1-4` will only add `SF` and `Dbpedia Topics` if they dont exist.
- `step 1-4` will make all specified `SF`  spottable
- `step 5-6` Only ADDS context words to the context of a dbpedia Topic.

# Using the scala console

Best way to play the models and modify them  is to use the scala console.

## Starting a scala console
- make sure your scala is 2.9.2
- start a scala console by doing:
```
scala  -classpath /path/to/jar/idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar  -J-Xmx4000M
```

`Xmx4000M` is the size of the java heap, this has to be big enough to be able to hold the models.

## Playing with the models

Once you start a scala console you can use it like `ipython` to create instances of the scala classes we have, to load the models, check if dbpedia id's exist, add new dbpedia ids, add new surface forms etc..

Example:

```
var spotlightModel = org.idio.dbpedia.spotlight.Main.getSpotlightModel( "/Users/dav009/Downloads/tr/model/")
spotlightModel.showSomeSurfaceForms()
spotlightModel.getStatsForSurfaceForm("evrimleri")
spotlightModel.searchForDBpediaResource("ikimono_gakari_dbpedia_uri")
spotlightModel.addNew("ikimono_gakari_sf","ikimono_gakari_dbpedia_uri",1,Array())
spotlightModel.exportModels("/new/path/of/folder/model/")
```

## Practical tips for updating a model

Given that the models are quite big (2 GB compressed), downloading, modifying and uploading them would be very
 time consuming from your local machine. Plus, the operations require a lot of ram, so you better boot a dev instance, and do the changes from there.
 Here's a list of steps.

1. Create the new instance:
`knife ec2 server create -r "role[spotlight]" -I ami-6d3f9704 -G default -x ubuntu --node-name "dev-spotlight" --environment "development" -f m3.xlarge --availability-zone us-east-1d --secret-file path/to/secret/file`

2. ssh into the new instance and install dependencies:
`sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk maven scala unzip`

3. Clone the dbpedia model editor repo:
`git clone git@github.com:idio/spotlight-model-editor.git`

4. Install the necessary dbpedia spotlight .jar file and compile ```
cd dbpedia-model-editor
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/usr/share/java/dbpedia-spotlight-0.6.jar -DgroupId=org.dbpedia -DartifactId=spotlight -Dversion=0.6 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn package ```

5. You can now use the model editor for a variety of tasks, for example, to remove SFs Topics associations stored in tab separated file, you can run (we assume the model is located in `/mnt/share/spotlight/`). 
`sudo java -Xmx15360M -Xms15360M -jar idio-spotlight-model-0.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar remove-sf-topic-association /mnt/share/spotlight/en/model ~/remove_associations`
The command would re-export the model, so you can just zip and upload the file to S3 to be used.

6. Write the changes you made into a changelog, so we can duplicate them from scratch if needed [need to decide where to store changes] .
